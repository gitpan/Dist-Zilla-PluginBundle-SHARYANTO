NAME
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::SHARYANTO - Dist::Zilla like SHARYANTO when
    you build your dists

VERSION
    version 0.08

SYNOPSIS
     # dist.ini
     [@SHARYANTO]

    is equivalent to:

     [@Filter]
     bundle=@Classic
     remove=PkgVersion
     remove=PodVersion
     remove=Readme

     [CheckChangeLog]
     [MetaJSON]
     [OurPkgVersion]
     [PodWeaver]
     [ReadmeFromPod]
     [Test::Compile]
     [Test::Rinci]

     [InstallRelease]
     install_command=cpanm -n .

     [Run::Release]
     ;notexist_fatal = 0
     run=archive-perl-release %s

DESCRIPTION
    For most dists, I use Module::Build instead of Extutils::MakeMaker. I
    avoid stuffs that might change line numbers (so I also always add #
    ABSTRACT and POD at the end after '1;'). I still maintain dependencies
    and increase version number manually.

    I install my dists after release. I also archive them. The
    "archive-perl-release" is a script on my computer, you can get them from
    my 'scripts' github repo but the release process won't fail if the
    script does not exist.
